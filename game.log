Welcome to our game!

Starting today, you are a new PhD student @ QPIT. During the next 1000 days, your job is managing your time to complete your PhD studies. Each day, you have to work on your project, take courses, and complete the tasks from DTU Fysik. Don't forget to spend some time having fun otherwise your stress level will increase and you'll risk burn out. 
Will you be able to complete all your goals and graduate in time?

Good luck!


Day 1:
Progress: 0%

You are starting your PhD. New job, new life, new city, ... It's the perfect time to close yourself in the office and start to understand what your project is about: "quantum cavity optoacoustic at cryogenic temperatures" seems such an interesting title!

Accept task (5 days):
I know nothing about optomechanics. I need to study hard so I can impress my supervisor during the next meeting.

Reschedule task:
Oh no, I'm already missing my old life, let me enjoy my freedom a bit more. ;)


Day 6:
Progress: 1%

Have you remembered to water the plants in the office? They are looking a bit sad.

Accept task (4 days):
"Water the plants. They are your only friends." (ChatGPT, 2024)

Reschedule task (4 days):
Look at the plants slowly withering away since they remind you of your own life.


Day 10:
Progress: 1%

The setup you're working on during your PhD is centered around a dilution refrigerator. This is a quite complex system that is around in QPIT since 7+ years ago. Your goal for the next months is to use this setup to characterize and manipulate the otomechanical respose of a quartz crystal. However, two weeks before the start of your PhD, the fridge stopped working.

Accept task (3 days):
I'm not getting demotivated by these small hiccups. I'll immediately try to understand what's going on.

Reschedule task:
Oh no, am I still in time to give up and change topic? Maybe I should come back in a few months...


Day 13:
Progress: 2%

While you where studing the manuals and testing checking the logs of the last cooldown, you discovered that the dilution fridge hasn't been maintained since 2020 when a colleague left. It isn't a great news, and it's probably the reason for the failure.

Accept task (2 days):
Contact Bluefors (the company who sold the fridge) and ask for directions about how to debug the system.

Reschedule task:
Wait for next week, and try to understand better what's going on and who was in charge of the maintenance.


Day 15:
Progress: 4%

Another important part of your PhD is helping the departing in saving some money. In the next months, you'll be involved in helping the professors in their teaching.

Accept task (5 days):
That's great! It's a good opportunity to learn more about teaching and improve my soft skills.

Reschedule task:

Day 20:
Progress: 5%

During your PhD, your project isn't the only task - you have to attend some courses, and prepare for some activities.

After several emails with Bluefors, they have figured out that there's a partial breakdown with the scroll pump. It cannot reach the nominal compression rate, and thus the low-pressure turbo pump cannot start operating to create vacuum in the chamber.

Accept task (2 days):
It seems like I have to self-teach how to become a mechanical technician. Spend some time checking the procedure in the maintenance manual of the fridge.
