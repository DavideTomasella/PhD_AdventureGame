Welcome to our game!

Starting today, you are a new PhD student @ QPIT. During the next 1000 days, your job is managing your time to complete your PhD studies. Each day, you have to work on your project, take courses, and complete the tasks from DTU Fysik. Don't forget to spend some time having fun otherwise your stress level will increase and you'll risk burn out. 
Will you be able to complete all your goals and graduate in time?

Good luck!
